# Destiny Community Carols
This is a very simple static site for a Christmas event. There are no build pipelines
just plain old HTML, CSS and a little JS. Optimized for SEO and page seed performance.

## Getting started
1. You'll need [git-lfs]
2. Clone this repo
3. Host it somewhere

## Notes
* CSS files are in the `css/` directory and minified versions are used by `index.html`.
* I wouldn't recommend storing minified resources in `git` but this thing is simple and small.
* Images are stored using [git-lfs]
